# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

You should always use the rules defined here when suggesting Tailwind CSS classes usages.

You should always avoid using position absolute as much as possible.

You should always use modern definitions like flexbox or grid as much as possible.

You should always use classes with mobile responsiveness first in mind then desktop.

You should always suggest the minimal number of classes in order to meet the requirements rather than bloating the entire HTML.
