# Exclude Action Performers from Notifications - Fix Documentation

## Problem Statement

Users were receiving notifications for actions they performed themselves, which created unnecessary notification noise and poor user experience. For example:

- Users would get notified when they assigned a task to themselves
- Users would see notifications when they assigned a form to themselves
- Users would receive approval notifications for requests they made if they were also approvers
- Users would get comment notifications for their own comments

## Solution Overview

The migration `20250718021838_exclude_action_performers_from_notifications.sql` fixes this issue by updating all notification trigger functions to exclude action performers from receiving notifications about their own actions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Task Assignment Notifications** ✅

- **Before**: Users would receive notifications when assigning tasks to themselves
- **After**: Added check `IF NEW.user_id = NEW.assigned_by THEN RETURN NEW;`
- **Impact**: Self-assignments no longer generate notifications

### 2. **Form Assignment Notifications** ✅

- **Before**: Users would receive notifications when assigning forms to themselves
- **After**: Added check `IF NEW.user_id = NEW.assigned_by THEN RETURN NEW;`
- **Impact**: Self-assignments no longer generate notifications

### 3. **Approval Workflow Notifications** ✅

- **Before**: Users might receive duplicate/confusing notifications in approval workflows
- **After**: Smart exclusion logic:
  - Requesters still get confirmation when they submit a request (intended behavior)
  - Requesters are excluded from approver notifications if they're also an approver
  - Approval status changes don't notify the person who made the change
  - Comment notifications exclude the commenter
  - Response notifications exclude the responder

### 4. **Core Notification Function** ✅

- **Added**: Additional safeguard in `create_notification()` function
- **Logic**: `IF p_created_by = p_user_id AND p_type NOT IN ('system', 'approval_requested')`
- **Impact**: Provides system-wide protection against action performer notifications

## Existing Good Patterns (Already Working)

These notification types already had proper exclusion logic:

- ✅ **Task Comments**: Already excluded commenters from their own comment notifications
- ✅ **Task Updates**: Already excluded updaters from task status change notifications
- ✅ **Project Membership**: Already excluded users from self-addition notifications
- ✅ **Organization Membership**: Already excluded users from self-addition notifications

## How to Apply This Fix

### Option 1: Apply the Migration (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Apply the migration
npx supabase db push

# Or apply specific migration
npx supabase migration up --target 20250718021838
```

### Option 2: Manual Application

If you need to apply this manually, run the SQL from the migration file:

1. Connect to your Supabase database
2. Execute the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250718021838_exclude_action_performers_from_notifications.sql`
3. Verify the functions have been updated

## Testing the Fix

After applying the migration, test these scenarios:

### 1. **Task Self-Assignment Test**

```sql
-- This should NOT create a notification for the assignee
INSERT INTO entity_assignees (entity_type, entity_id, user_id, assigned_by)
VALUES ('task', 123, 'user-uuid', 'user-uuid');  -- same user
```

### 2. **Form Self-Assignment Test**

```sql
-- This should NOT create a notification for the assignee
INSERT INTO entity_assignees (entity_type, entity_id, user_id, assigned_by)
VALUES ('form', 456, 'user-uuid', 'user-uuid');  -- same user
```

### 3. **Approval Workflow Test**

- Create an approval request where the requester is also an approver
- Verify requester gets confirmation but not approver notification
- Verify status changes don't notify the person making the change

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **Will Still Receive Notifications:**

- Task assignments from other users
- Form assignments from other users
- Comments from other users
- Approval requests (confirmation for requesters)
- System notifications
- Organization/project invitations from others

### ❌ **Will No Longer Receive Notifications:**

- Self-assigning tasks
- Self-assigning forms
- Own comments on tasks/approvals
- Approval status changes you make
- Task updates you make yourself

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Added simple equality checks (`user_id = created_by`)
- **Improvement**: Reduces unnecessary database writes and notification queue processing
- **Network**: Fewer real-time notifications sent to clients

## Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing notification data
- **Database**: Works with existing notification tables and preferences
- **API**: No changes required to notification API endpoints
- **UI**: No changes required to notification components

## Files Modified

1. `supabase/migrations/20250718021838_exclude_action_performers_from_notifications.sql`
   - Updated `notify_task_assignment_changes()`
   - Updated `notify_form_assignment_changes()`
   - Updated `notify_approval_changes()`
   - Updated `notify_approval_comment()`
   - Updated `notify_approval_response()`
   - Enhanced `create_notification()` with safeguard

## Verification Commands

After applying the fix, verify with these queries:

```sql
-- Check that the functions were updated
SELECT proname, prosrc
FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname IN (
  'notify_task_assignment_changes',
  'notify_form_assignment_changes',
  'notify_approval_changes',
  'create_notification'
);

-- Test notification creation
SELECT create_notification(
  p_user_id => 'test-user-uuid',
  p_type => 'task_assigned',
  p_created_by => 'test-user-uuid'  -- Same user - should return NULL
);
```

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the migration can be rolled back by restoring the previous function definitions from the consolidated notification system migration (`20250705211438_consolidated_notification_system.sql`).

**Status**: ✅ Ready to Deploy  
**Priority**: High (UX Improvement)  
**Risk**: Low (No breaking changes)
