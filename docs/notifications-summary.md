# Notification System - Executive Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive, production-ready notification system through a **single consolidated migration** that leverages Supabase's powerful features to deliver real-time, multi-channel notifications with minimal application code complexity.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Consolidated, Idempotent Architecture**

The entire notification system is deployed through one migration file:

- **Single Deployment**: Everything in `20250705211438_consolidated_notification_system.sql`
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times without data loss
- **Complete**: Types, tables, indexes, policies, functions, and triggers
- **Production Ready**: Handles existing installations and upgrades

### 2. **Database-Driven Architecture**

The entire notification logic lives in PostgreSQL triggers, making the system:

- **Reliable**: Database transactions ensure notifications are never lost
- **Performant**: No application overhead for notification creation
- **Maintainable**: Business logic centralized in one place
- **Scalable**: Automatic processing with optimized indexes

### 3. **Multi-Channel Delivery**

- **In-App**: Real-time via Supabase WebSockets (instant)
- **Email**: Queued with priority-based delivery (5-30 min scheduling)
- **Push**: Mobile and web push notifications (immediate delivery)

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**

- Mandatory system notifications (non-configurable)
- Granular per-type and per-channel preferences
- **Enhanced approval workflows** with comprehensive collaboration
- Smart priority-based delivery timing
- Real-time UI updates and engagement tracking

## Database Schema Highlights

### Complete Migration: `20250705211438_consolidated_notification_system.sql`

**6 Core Tables**:

```
notifications              (Core notification records)
├── notification_deliveries    (Delivery tracking by channel)
├── notification_preferences   (User preferences per type)
├── email_queue               (Priority-based email delivery)
├── push_queue                (Push notification queue)
└── user_devices              (Push notification devices)
```

**13 Notification Types**:

- `system` - Mandatory system notifications
- `organization_added` - Organization membership
- `project_added` - Project membership
- `task_assigned` - Task assignments
- `task_updated` - Task status changes
- `task_comment` - Task comments
- `comment_mention` - @mentions in comments
- `task_unassigned` - Task removals
- `form_assigned` - Form assignments
- `form_unassigned` - Form removals
- `approval_requested` - Approval requests
- `approval_status_changed` - Approval decisions
- `entity_assigned` - Generic entity assignments

**Performance Optimizations**:

- **15 strategic indexes** for common queries
- **Conditional partial indexes** for efficient filtering
- **Optimized query patterns** for high-volume operations

## Real-time Features

### Instant Notification Delivery

```typescript
// Real-time subscription with automatic UI updates
const subscription = supabase
  .channel(`user-notifications:${userId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: 'INSERT', table: 'notifications' }, (payload) => {
    showNotificationToast(payload.new);
    updateNotificationCount();
  })
  .subscribe();
```

### Enhanced Approval Workflow

```
Approval Request → Requester: "Request submitted"
                → Approvers: "Review needed"

Comment Added → Requester: "New comment"
              → Other Approvers: "Comment added"

Response Given → Requester: "Response received"
               → Other Approvers: "Approver responded"

Final Decision → Requester: "Decision made"
```
